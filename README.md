# Flight-Reservation-System

A project to manage flights, bookings, payments, and pricing with flexible components and easy-to-extend interfaces. This system includes flexible bookings with seat assignment and status tracking, two flight types (domestic and international), a payment processor with validation and refunds, and a pricing strategy system that applies discounts, taxes, and seasonal promotions. It uses interfaces for cancellations, refunds, changes, and custom pricing logic.
